# Product Requirements Document: In-Memory Database Service

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Purpose
The In-Memory Database Service is a high-performance, lightweight database solution designed to provide fast data operations through in-memory storage. It serves as a RESTful API service built with FastAPI, offering basic database operations and join capabilities.

### 1.2 Target Users
- Backend developers requiring fast in-memory data operations
- Development teams needing a lightweight database service for testing and development
- Applications requiring quick data access and simple join operations

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Core Features

#### 2.1.1 Data Storage
- **Must Have:**
  - In-memory storage using Python dictionaries
  - Support for multiple data tables
  - Persistence of data during runtime
  - Support for different data types (strings, numbers, nested objects)

#### 2.1.2 API Endpoints
- **Must Have:**
  - POST /api/v1/data/{table} - Create new records
  - GET /api/v1/data/{table}/{id} - Retrieve records
  - PUT /api/v1/data/{table}/{id} - Update records
  - DELETE /api/v1/data/{table}/{id} - Delete records
  - GET /api/v1/join/{table1}/{table2}/{key} - Join operations
  - GET /api/v1/dump/{table} - Dump table contents

### 2.2 Data Models

#### 2.2.1 Base Requirements
- Implement Pydantic models for data validation
- Support for required and optional fields
- Type validation for all fields
- Support for nested data structures

#### 2.2.2 Sample Data Models
```python
# Example User Model
{
    "id": "uuid",
    "email": "string",
    "full_name": "string",
    "age": "integer",
    "created_at": "datetime"
}

# Example Order Model
{
    "id": "uuid",
    "user_id": "uuid",
    "product_name": "string",
    "quantity": "integer",
    "total_price": "float",
    "order_date": "datetime"
}
```

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Technology Stack
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Container:** Docker

- Response time < 500ms for join operations
- Support for concurrent requests
- Efficient memory utilization

### 3.3 Security Requirements
- Input validation for all API endpoints
- Proper error handling and status codes
- Rate limiting capabilities
- Sanitized error messages

## 4. Quality Assurance

### 4.1 Testing Requirements
