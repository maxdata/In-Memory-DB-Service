    email: EmailStr
    full_name: str = Field(min_length=1, max_length=100)
    age: Optional[int] = Field(gt=0, lt=150)

class UserCreate(UserBase):
    password: str = Field(min_length=8)

class UserResponse(UserBase):
    id: UUID
    created_at: datetime

# Order Models
class OrderBase(BaseModel):
    user_id: UUID = Field(foreign_key="user.id")
    product_name: str = Field(min_length=1, max_length=200)
    quantity: int = Field(gt=0)
    total_price: Decimal = Field(gt=0)
